Please provide a code example for review by solving the following problem. The code may be written in a
language of your choice that you are capable of executing. Please submit the solution to either GitHub in
an accessible location and provide a link through email (please send the assignment or any questions you
may have to recruiting_people@vailsys.com or by replying to this email chain).

The problem we would like you to solve deals with an array of integers. We want to rotate these integers
to a specified number of positions to the left.

If for example you have an array of integers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and we would like to rotate 2 positions to the
left, the solution expected would be [3,4,5,6,7,1,2].

Note: the solution should be able to handle a position value greater than the number of integers in the
array. If, for example, we would like to rotate [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] 8 positions to left, it would produce the
result [2,3,4,5,6,7,1]. Negative values for the positions to rotate will throw an error which the code
example should handle gracefully.
